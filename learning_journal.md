**What Confused Me at First**
I struggled to understand why the Dirac Hamiltonian applies to graphene when electrons are not actually relativistic. Reading about band structure and linear dispersion near the K-point helped me realize this is an effective model, not a literal one.

**What Broke in My Code**
My first simulations exploded numerically because my time step was too large. Reducing Δt and learning why numerical stability matters was one of the biggest practical lessons for me.

**What Surprised Me**
The coherence decayed much faster than I expected. That made me think about how biological systems must constantly spend energy to keep signals alive, rather than relying on passive physical dynamics.

**What I Would Do Differently**
If I repeated this project, I would add a simple neuron model and directly compare physical decay curves with biological spike trains instead of only making a conceptual comparison.
