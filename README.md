# Graphene Electron Wavepacket Dynamics

**Project type:** Independent computational physics project (gap year)

**Description:**  
This repository contains code developed for an independent research project modeling ultrafast electron wavepacket dynamics in graphene using a Dirac-Hamiltonian framework. The simulations implement the time-dependent Schrödinger equation with split-operator Fourier methods to study electron coherence on attosecond–femtosecond timescales.

**Contents:**  
- `simulation.py` — main code for wavepacket evolution  
- `plots.py` — generates figures (heatmaps, temporal decay)  
- `results/` — sample output figures  
- `parameters.txt` — simulation parameters

**Skills & Methods:**  
Quantum mechanics, computational physics, numerical simulation, Python/MATLAB programming, data visualization

**Note:** This project was conducted independently during my gap year. Code and results are for educational and academic portfolio purposes.
